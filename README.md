# UnityTextureResizer
Script to resize existing sprite to the multiply of 4.

The script of resizing was taken here https://github.com/ababilinski/unity-gpu-texture-resize

#How it works
1) Enable read/write option on texture/sprite.
2) Disable compression if there is. It wont work with compressed textures.
2) Right click on texture -> Resizer -> choose the proper option.
3) Now you can disable read/write option and choose the compression.
